# promptoglyph

## What the?

promptoglyph is a set of tools for shell prompts.
It currently has two parts:

- `promptoglyph-path`, which prints a [fish](http://fishshell.com/)-like shortening
  of your current directory.

- `promptoglyph-vcs`, which uses glyphs to give you a quick overview of your
  Git repository status.
  Unlike existing solutions such as the
  [vcs_info](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/User-Contributions.html#Gathering-information-from-version-control-systems)
  plugin for Zsh or [oh-my-git](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git),
  `promptoglyph-vcs` stops running after a user-specified amount of
  time so that fetching the status of your repo doesn't make your prompt laggy.

Together, you can use them to build a prompt like this:

More to follow.

## Why is it called promptoglyph?

It was originally called `promptd` because it is a *prompt* that gives the
current <em>d</em>irectory and is written in [D](http://dlang.org).
But someone made the valid point that the name implies a daemon,
so I went with promptoglyph.
Cheesy, but according to a cursory Google search, unique.

## How do I get it?

Linux builds can be found at the
[releases](https://github.com/mrkline/promptoglyph/releases) page.
They haven't been tested extensively across many distros,
but Probably Workâ„¢ since they only depend on vanilla C libraries
(pthread, libm, librt, libc).

Alternatively, building form source is simple.

### Windows builds
Please build from source for now.

## How do I build it?
Grab a [D compiler](http://dlang.org/download.html) and follow the instructions for your platform below.
That's all.
There are no dependencies.

promptoglyph will be added as a [Dub](http://code.dlang.org) package soon-ish.


### Posix-compliant systems (like Linux, Mac OS X, etc.)
Just run `make release` and you should be set.

### Windows
Run `build.bat -r` to build the release version.
Run `build.bat -d` to build the debug version.


## How do I use it for my prompt?

Just invoke the programs with the desired options (see their `--help` info)
in your prompt expression.

### Posix-compliant systems (like Linux, Mac OS X, etc.)
In Zsh (for the prompt shown in the demo):

```shell
setopt PROMPT_SUBST
setopt PROMPT_PERCENT
PROMPT='%B$(promptoglyph-path) $(promptoglyph-vcs --zsh) %%%b '
```

In Bash,

```shell
PS1="\$(promptoglyph-path) \$(promptoglyph-vcs --bash) % "
```

### Windows
For the default *cmd.exe* you are out of luck, as it does not support custom program execution and only has a limited number of available options.

Powershell on the other hand can use promptoglyph to enhance its prompt. 
You will need to configure your [Powershell $profile](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847857.aspx) to set your prompt accordingly.
Example Profile.ps1 (or Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1) file:

```powershell
# may have to set this first:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

# . $profile # ==> reload powershell config

function prompt 
{
    $identity = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()
    $principal = [Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] $identity
    # promptoglyph.exe must be available in the %PATH%
    $git = & "promptoglyph-vcs.exe" 2>&1 | Out-String

    $(if (test-path variable:/PSDebugContext) { '[DBG]: ' } 

    elseif($principal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator"))
    { "[ADMIN]: " }

    else { '' }) + 'PS ' + $(Get-Location) + ' ' + $git + $(if ($nestedpromptlevel -ge 1) { '>>' }) + '> '
}
```

For *Cygwin* you can use the compiled exe files and copy them into /usr/local/bin for example and then use them in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile configuration. Unfortunately colored output is not yet supported. Feel free to help improving the situation by digging into the code.


## It's 2015. Why are you generating a prompt with a compiled program?

I was using Zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh),
but it seemed to be really slow in some cases and someone on Reddit
[raised some concerns about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/pvbfp/zsh_a_bash_alternative_thats_easily_customizable/c3smc2d).
I could try [the fork](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto),
but I figured it wouldn't hurt to slim down my Zsh config
to things I actually use.
After doing that, all that remained was the need for a decent prompt.
I'm allergic to writing a shell script more than five lines long, 
and some of my goals (like hard time limits)
seemed easier in a "real" programming language instead of a Zsh script.
So, I started this project.

## What additions are planned?

- Support for additional VCSes, starting with SVN and Mercurial

- Additional Git info (such as the name of a branch being merged)

- Colorized path output
